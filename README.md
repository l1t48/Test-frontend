# Book & Quotes Management Frontend

## Introduction
This is the frontend application for a book and quotes management system, built with Angular 20 and TypeScript. It provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for managing books and quotes, supporting authentication, CRUD 
operations, and dynamic content rendering.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Angular 20 – Frontend framework for building the application.
- Font Awesome - Icons.
- Bootstrap – Responsive CSS framework for styling and layout.
- SignalR – Real-time updates for books and quotes.
- HTTP Interceptor – Handles authentication tokens and request/response processing globally in the app.

## Installation & Running

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following are installed on your system:
- Node.js v20.19.0 – Required for Angular 20 to work correctly.
- npm (Node Package Manager) – Comes with Node.js.
- A modern browser for testing the frontend.

### Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project root and run: ``` npm install ```. This installs all required packages, including Angular 20, Bootstrap, and SignalR for real-time updates.

### Running Locally (Development)
To start a local development server: ``` ng serve ```. The application will be available at http://localhost:4200 by default.

### Building for Production
To create a production-ready build: ``` ng build --configuration production ```. Compiles and optimizes the application into the dist/ folder.

## Environment Configuration
The frontend requires configuration to connect to the backend API and manage application settings.

| Variable                  | Description                                  | Example Value               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL_LOCAL` | Base URL for API requests (including `/api`) | `http://localhost:5069/api` |
| `VITE_BASE_URL_LOCAL`     | Base URL for the backend (without `/api`)    | `http://localhost:5069`     |


## Frontend Test Verification Checklist

The following table summarizes all frontend functionality tests conducted to ensure proper CRUD operations, authentication, responsive design, user experience, and API validation (All API text validation rules were tested in the frontend.
